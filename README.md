# drqn-prl-pomdp
A PyTorch implementation of a Deep Recurrent Q-Network (DRQN) agent solving a Probabilistic Reversal Learning (PRL) task. This project benchmarks the agent's learned strategy and cognitive flexibility against human behavioral data (Weiss et al., 2021) by treating the task as a POMDP.
